## My Education Background

I am a current senior at Georgetown College that will graduate in May 2026. I attended high school at Letcher County Central High School in Whitesburg, KY where I graduated in 2022. I am majoring in Health Science with a minor in Computer Science. 

## Outside of the Classroom

Other than being a student, I am also an athlete on Georgetown's campus. I attend GC on a cheerleading scholarship to be on the sideline team and UCA Gameday competitive team. Outside of GC, I am a volunteer teacher at Grace Christian Church in Georgetown where I teach ages 6 weeks to 5 years old during Sunday services. I am deeply rooted in my faith and enjoy working with children in this setting. 

## Future Plans

With my major and background in athletics, I plan to attend graduate school for Occupational Therapy. Ideal situation for myself would be to attend OT School in Johnson City, TN where I would specialize in Pediatrics and graduate in the Winter of 2028. I have obtained almost 400 observation hours and feel that this occupation is my calling. 

## My Family

I am the youngest-ish of FIVE girls where I have a twin sister and three older sisters. My sisters and I have all attended NAIA colleges in the Mid-South Conference while on athletic scholarships for a variety of sports. My parents are both from Letcher County, KY and attended college at Morehead State University where my dad obtained an IT degree and my mother a degree in Social Work. My dad works for Appalachain Regional Healthcare and my mother is a Social Worker for the state of Kentucky. My sisters work in a variety of jobs including Marketing, Nursing, Psychology, and restaurant management. My family have played large roles in my educational, athletics, and life outside of school.
